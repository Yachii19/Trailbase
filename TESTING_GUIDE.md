# SkillSync Pro - Complete Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### Step 1: Get Your Wallet Address as Admin

1. **Connect your wallet** to the app (Coinbase Wallet recommended)
2. **Copy your wallet address** from the wallet UI
3. **Add yourself as admin**:
   - Open `src/lib/verification.ts`
   - Find the `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` array (around line 28)
   - Add your wallet address:
   ```typescript
   const ADMIN_ADDRESSES = [
     '0xAdminWallet1234567890123456789012345678901',
     '0xYourActualWalletAddressHere', // <-- Add your address
   ];
   ```
4. **Save the file** - the dev server will auto-reload

### Step 2: Start Both Servers

#### Terminal 1 - Backend Server
```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Expected output: `Server running on http://localhost:5000`

#### Terminal 2 - Frontend Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```
Expected output: `Local: http://localhost:3002`

### Step 3: Open the Application

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3002`
2. Connect your Coinbase Wallet
3. Ensure you're on **Base Sepolia** network

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Admin Panel Not Showing"

**Problem**: You don't see the Admin Panel tab in VeriScribe

**Solution**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check your connected wallet address
3. Add your address to `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` in `src/lib/verification.ts`
4. Reload page (Ctrl+R)

### Issue 2: "Wallet Search Not Working"

**Problem**: Searching for certificates by wallet returns nothing

**Solution**:
- Wallet addresses are case-sensitive in some places
- Updated code to use `.toLowerCase()` for all comparisons
- Try searching with the exact address format from the wallet

**Fixed Code**:
```typescript
// Now case-insensitive
export const isAdmin = (address: string): boolean => {
  return NORMALIZED_ADMIN_ADDRESSES.includes(address.toLowerCase());
};
```

### Issue 3: "Transaction Failing"

**Problem**: Transactions revert or fail

**Solution**:
1. **Check network**: Must be on Base Sepolia
2. **Check balance**: Need ETH for gas + USDC for gigs
3. **Check contract deployment**: Contracts must be deployed first
4. **Check wallet approval**: Some actions need approval transactions first

### Issue 4: "Backend Not Connecting"

**Problem**: Frontend can't reach backend API

**Solution**:
1. Check backend is running: `http://localhost:5000/health`
2. Check CORS settings in `backend/server.js`
3. Update frontend API calls to use correct URL:
   ```typescript
   const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';
   ```

### Issue 5: "MongoDB Connection Error"

**Problem**: Backend shows MongoDB connection error

**Solution**:
1. Check `backend/.env` has valid MongoDB URI
2. Verify MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes your IP
3. Check database user credentials
