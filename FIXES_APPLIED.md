# üîß Quick Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:

### 1. ERC20_ABI Duplicate Declaration
**Problem:** `ERC20_ABI` was exported twice in `contracts.ts`
- Line 21: Original declaration
- Line 77: Duplicate alias

**Fix:** Removed the duplicate alias at line 77

---

### 2. CORS Already Configured
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already fixed
- Backend accepts requests from ports 3000, 3001, 3002
- No changes needed

---

### 3. Hydration Warning (Browser Extension)
**Problem:** Grammarly extension modifying HTML attributes
```
data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded
data-gr-ext-installed
```

**Solution:** This is harmless - it's from your Grammarly browser extension
- Not a code issue
- To remove warning: Disable Grammarly on localhost
- Or ignore it (doesn't affect functionality)

---

## üöÄ To Test Now:

### Step 1: Start Backend
```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev
```
‚úÖ Should see: "Server running on port 5000" and "MongoDB connected"

### Step 2: Check Frontend
- Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3002
- ERC20_ABI error should be gone
- CORS error should be gone (if backend is running)

### Step 3: Verify in UI
1. Go to VeriScribe ‚Üí Admin Panel
2. Click "Check Backend" button
3. Should see: üü¢ "Backend: Online | MongoDB: ‚úÖ"

---

## üêõ Remaining Issues:

### Hydration Warning (Grammarly)
**Not a bug** - Just your browser extension
- Safe to ignore
- Or disable Grammarly on localhost

---

## ‚ú® All Fixed!

Your app should now work without errors. The only "warning" left is from Grammarly modifying the DOM, which is cosmetic and doesn't break anything.
